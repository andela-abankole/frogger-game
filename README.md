## How To Use And Interface
This Game is simpler than it looks.

In the game you'll control characters, named Warriors.

Their names are **Warriors**.  You'll use the **arrow keys**...

...to move Warriors around. 

All along the way you're going to be avoiding these guys...

**...rampaging enemy bugs!** 

Oh, and getting into the **water** gives you points.  Your warriors don't know how to swim, but gets points.

There's no end to the game!  Just see how far you can get and how high you can keep your score! And that's about it!  Use the **arrow keys** to move warriors.

I hope you enjoy the game!!
